## what is a [Linear System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_system "Linear System")

## behavior of this code

while showing its work and making its desicion process known the code should do the following:

take a linear systems as a array of strings or as a array of numbers that confrom to the augmented matrix notation
if it is an array of strings convert it into augmented matrix notation
find out if the systems has: no solution, one solution, infinite solutions
if there is one or more solutions then define them for the user

optionaly to graph the system
